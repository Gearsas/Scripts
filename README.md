# Scripts

Note:
This project was done out of personal interest.

Runemate is a platform that allows users to automate aspects of the game RuneScape.

**Warning: using third-party software is against the terms of service from RuneScape**

Personally, writing these scripts has helped me get into development, specifically Java. This is the reason behind this repository: completing the circle of learning.

"MACROING AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE/HARDWARE
People also call this â€˜botting.' It means using software or hardware that can help you play the game with the software or hardware doing things for you that you should be doing yourself. Our games are meant to be played by humans - if you cheat, you are likely to be banned, even if it is the first time you have broken the rules."

In other words by using this script you risk your account getting suspended or temprarily banned for macroing.


some aspects in repository have been deleted to avoid people directly stealing this script and uploading it. Manifest files containing internal ID's have been removed.
This is up to the user (you) to implement later on.
