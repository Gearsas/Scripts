"MACROING AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE/HARDWARE
People also call this â€˜botting.' It means using software or hardware that can help you play the game with the software or hardware doing things for you that you should be doing yourself. Our games are meant to be played by humans - if you cheat, you are likely to be banned, even if it is the first time you have broken the rules."

In other words by using this script you risk your account getting suspended or temprarily banned for macroing.
